Plus a github introduction:

Global setup:
 Set up git
  git config --global user.name "enimo"
  git config --global user.email enimoxxx@gmail.com
      
Next steps:
  mkdir demo
  cd demo
  git init
  touch README
  vi README //add your introduction or something you like
  git add README
  git commit -m 'first commit'

The code above executes actions locally, meaning you still haven’t done anything on GitHub yet. To connect your local repository to your GitHub account, you will need to set a remote for your repo and push your commits to it:

  git remote add origin git@github.com:enimo/demo.git
  git push -u origin master

Last step:
If you change your code online, you should update you local respository like this:
	git pull
If that make no sense, then try this below:
	git push -u origin master
First push to online take command above, after that you can only type this:
	git push

Anyway, once you changed your local code and want to push to online, you should run the command above.
